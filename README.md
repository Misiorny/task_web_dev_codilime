## Important information

**Created static web with React according to e-mail information**

> Only static layout needed.

- Hope, I understand it properly - change
  on web was implement only by using CSS.

#### Information about coding

- Hard to know what UI/UX designer idea was but made it with my sense
  of beauty

    - semantic tags are used but hard to know which tag will be better
      due to latin "Lorem" text,  

- There is no mobile version,
- Lack of experience and the related need to look for solutions is the
  main reason for the poor level of task performance. Looks like Figma design.
- I know it could be better made for example with names of class or better quality of props and props names.  Tried to make it with BEM convince, but I know I made mistakes. Due to lack of time I send it with some errors in class names.
